# XR Caption
### Subtitles for Mixed Reality and Accessibility (a11y)

XR Caption is an innovative solution for enhancing accessibility in mixed reality environments. This project enables real-time subtitles to appear in augmented reality (AR) settings, making information more accessible for individuals with hearing impairments. The project was prototyped at **FIU ShellHacks** for Microsoft's Mixed Reality Challenge and leverages cutting-edge AI and AR technologies.

## Features
- **Real-Time Subtitles**: Adds AI-generated captions to mixed reality experiences.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Designed to help the hearing impaired "hear with their eyes."
- **Classroom Integration**: Enhances educational settings by improving accessibility.
- **Open-Source AR Headset**: Utilizes a 3D-printed design that fits smartphones to reflect captions directly into the user’s view.

---

## Technology Stack
- **AI**: Built using OpenAI Whisper for real-time transcription and language processing.
- **Web Framework**: Developed with Three.js for rendering AR experiences.
- **Hardware**: An open-source, 3D-printed AR headset compatible with smartphones.
