# XR-Caption
Subtitles for Mixed Reality and a11y

At FIU ShellHacks, I prototyped XR Caption for Microsoft's Mixed Reality Challenge. XR Caption adds subtitles to reality to improve accessibility to information and can be used in the classroom to enhance education. Goal to enable the disabled, to hear with our eyes using AI. Built with OpenAI Whisper and ThreeJs. The AR headset is an open-source 3D printed design that fits a user’s smartphone to reflect the AI generated captions into the wearer’s eyes.
